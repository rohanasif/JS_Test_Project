# **Instructions**
## **Project Structure:**
The project contains a total of 7 files:

- An index.html for HTML content.
- Four JS files.
- This README file.
- A style.css file for styling.
  ## **Explaination:**
The 7 files are pretty self-explanatory with comments added throughout. In case a user doesn’t understand, here are some basics:

1. The constants.js file contains constants used throughout the js files. These include both variables and functions.
1. The homescreen.js contains code to render the welcome screen and display the popular movies for that particular day.
1. The titlesearch.js contains code to handle search submission for title searches. It then renders the most relevent search results and displays them as cards.
1. The keywordsearch.js contains code to handle search submission for keyword searches. It does the same job as titlesearch.js but with keywords and displays them as cards.
